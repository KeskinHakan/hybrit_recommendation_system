Anime Recommendation - Hybrid Recommendation System

Recommendation systems are used to provide personalized recommendations to users, based on their preferences and past behavior. Two popular approaches to building recommendation systems are Item-based Collaborative Filtering (ICF) and User-based Collaborative Filtering (UCF).

Item-based Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation technique that looks at the similarity between items and recommends items that are similar to the ones the user has already liked. In contrast, User-based Collaborative Filtering is a recommendation technique that looks at the similarity between users and recommends items that similar users have liked in the past.

Hybrid Recommendation Systems combine these two approaches to provide better recommendations. By combining the strengths of both ICF and UCF, Hybrid systems can provide more accurate recommendations, especially when dealing with sparse data.

In Hybrid Recommendation Systems by Item and User-Based Collaborative Filtering, the system uses both the user's past behavior and the similarity between items to provide recommendations. It first identifies similar items to the ones the user has already liked and then identifies users who have similar tastes and preferences to the user. Finally, the system combines these two approaches to provide personalized recommendations to the user.

Overall, Hybrid Recommendation Systems by Item and User-Based Collaborative Filtering are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide accurate and personalized recommendations, even when dealing with sparse data.
